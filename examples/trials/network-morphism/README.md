# Network Morphism for Automatic Model Architecture Search 
This example shows us how to use Network Morphism to find good model architectures for deep learning.

## run 
```bash
nnictl create --config config.yaml
```

## framework support
Frameworks support list in https://github.com/onnx/tutorials due to the intermedia represtentation onnx. There frameworks should require both exporting to onnx and importing onnx models.
